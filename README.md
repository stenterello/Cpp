# C++ Modules

The C++ Modules repository contains my solutions to the C++ modules offered by the 42School curriculum. These modules provide a comprehensive introduction to C++ programming language, covering various topics and concepts.

## Description

The C++ modules offered by 42School are designed to provide a solid foundation in C++ programming and help students develop their skills in object-oriented programming. Each module focuses on specific aspects of the language and explores different topics, allowing students to gain a deep understanding of C++ and its features.

Some of the main objectives and characteristics of the C++ modules include:

- Learning the fundamentals of C++ programming, including syntax, data types, variables, and control structures.
- Understanding object-oriented programming principles, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Exploring advanced C++ concepts, including templates, exceptions, operator overloading, and standard template library (STL).
- Developing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills through practical exercises and projects.
- Gaining experience in implementing real-world applications and working with external libraries.
- Understanding best practices, coding conventions, and software engineering principles specific to C++ development.

The C++ modules provide a structured learning path, enabling students to gradually build their knowledge and proficiency in C++ programming.
